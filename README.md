# The Anemone Of My Anemone

A quiet, deliberate odyssey through a world that feels alive and unfamiliar.
You are an anemone—small, persistent, and searching. Grasp, release, and drift through the strange terrain in pursuit of the one you’ve lost.

## Running Locally

You just need to serve the files somehow:

```
python3 -m http.server
```

## Questions for Alex

 - how can we do shaders with transparent regions?
 - can we 'simple color code' a region and use the primary color channel of a pixel on the mat to decide which pixel effect to draw there? like green screen shit?

## Level Concepts

- Coral Reef (tutorial level, w/ your friend the clown fish? grab rocks to wait for predators to leave areas, don't drift into view)
- Kelp Forest (the maze can change/shift)
- Deep Sea Trench (currents from thermal vents help but hurt)
- Sewer (currents may help, but you need to stop before you get pushed into pollution)

## Mechanic Concepts

- Push to grab or release when near something grab-able
- Push to sink or float when in open water
- Push to grab and attack when near prey/enemy

## Currents
Currents are shown by environmental hints such as plankton, bioluminscent organisms, sea week, sand, bubbles, etc moving in a direction. Currents can be linear, curved, eddy currents, or even waves that push you out of the water!
